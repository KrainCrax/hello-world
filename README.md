# hello-world
My hello world repository
Here i am testing git and this looks cool but im a little bit scared that if i ever try to use Git locally on my computer it wont have such a nice interface and i will have to learn a new set of linux commands for a new CLI.... but whatever, lets enjoy the easyness of github.
